    <div><h1>Google meet</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Given the situation: We have Anna, a Computer Science teacher, that does online, one on one tutoring as a part-time job. She combines communicative and task-based pedagogical approaches, to enhance her student's coding skills in C++ language. One of her students really needs her help and she is going to help him right away, using Google Meet. 
                </p>
                <p>Existing <b>affordances</b>(*a),<b> visual variables</b> (*v) and <b>interaction flows</b>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="element_pad">New meeting button with a video camera icon and label next to it(*a). The button has a bright, blue color which is easy to see on the main page(*v)(the rest of it is mostly black and grey)
                    </li>
                    <li class="element_pad">3 easy and well-explained options: create a meeting for later, start an instant meeting, and schedule in Google Calendar(*a). The teacher will choose to start an instant meeting. 
                    </li >
                    <li class="element_pad">The video conference is now started, and an instant popup appears, with a button just as visible as the new meeting button, having a human and a plus icon, labeled with Add others (*a,*v). The teacher will click on it. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="element_pad">An input with an “ Enter name or email ” placeholder will appear(*a), letting Anna know that she has to type her student's name. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="element_pad">A send email button will appear, and her student will be notified.</li>
                    <li class="element_pad">Another popup appears shortly, and she will have to select accept button, to let her student be in the meeting.</li>
                    <li class="element_pad">She has a bar menu, at the bottom of the page, with many icon buttons. When hovering over them, labels appear, and the cursor changes. (*a)
                    </li>
                    <li class="element_pad">She needs to start a whiteboard, to explain a specific concept, so she presses on the 3-dot icon and selects whiteboard. She uses the menu, on the left side of the board and selects the pen icon(*a), to write something. </li>
                    <li class="element_pad">After finishing, she closes the tab with the board and ends the call, by using the biggest button from the menu, colored in red, with a phone icon.(*a,*v)</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li><p><b>Idioms in Google Meet:</b> scroll bars, drop-downs, hyperlinks(to the meeting);
            </p></li>
            <p>Visual metaphors in Google Meet: trash cans, magnifying glasses, exclamation marks, cogwheels, little hand, camera, microphone;</p>
            <p>Google Meet uses both idioms and visual metaphors and they both have pros and cons. </p>
            <p>Metaphors are easy to understand and reduce anxiety, being processed quickly due to their familiar visual form, while idioms are easily retained by the human mind. 
            </p>
            <p>For text-only interactions, idioms and metaphors can be replaced by key worlds like home, cut, back, and settings.</p>
            
            <li><p><b>Cognitive overload</b> in special conditions:</p></li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Given the situation: you are a teacher and you hold a meeting with 100 students. You have to split them into 10 breakout rooms and assign them manually to a certain breakout room. You have to do this during your call, which is going to take a lot of time and you will most probably feel overwhelmed. </p></li>
                <li><p>Given the situation: you are a teacher and you hold a meeting with 100 students. A lot of your students have their microphones unmuted and there is a lot of noise made in the background. You do not want to mute everyone else because you need to interact with some of them, so you have to scroll through the whole participant list, find the ones that make noise, and mute them in particular. </p></li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Improvements</b> that can be made:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The first improvement that can be made in Google Meet is related to the host option of muting everyone at once and not permitting them to turn on their microphone during the meeting. This stops the host from communicating with others at all through voice, which can be a problem. So, my solution is to improve that button's option, by giving the host the ability to let specific persons from their meeting to unmute themselves, even if that option is turned on. This applies to Web and mobile native as well.</p></li>
                <li><p>Another improvement that can be made is related to the share screen option and seeing the full screen. When watching someone's presentation on full screen, by default, you get to see on one-third of your screen, other participants' videos(their faces) and on the rest, the presentation. For most users, this can be very unpleasant, because people want to see the screen, not something else. To stop this from happening, you have to pin, by yourself, the one who presents their screen, and then press the full-screen button. My Improvement would be switching these two, from default to option and the other way around. This feels more natural and easy to use. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Another thing that can be improved is related to the board tools. They clearly need an upgrade, because they limit the user's experience too much. For example, the eraser's size is standard, but for most users, too small. My improvement would be adjustability in size. Also, the select option is limited to images or text boxes, but not to what you write on the board using the pen, which, again, can be an obstacle for most users. My improvement would be extending the select option to all kinds of content that appear on the board.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Empiric laws</b> and examples</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Fitts' law</b> example: When we press the “more options” button, the options appear right next to the button(on Web) and on top of the button, in the lower screen(on mobile). This determines a shorter period of time, in both cases, because the distance to the target is minimum. Also, On Web, the options have icons and are also labeled, and the button to the options includes the icon and the label too. This determines a bigger size of the target, which is a huge advantage. This applies to mobile too, but the buttons are smaller, adapted to the phone's screen size, of course.</p></li>
                <p>What can be adapted in this case, is reordering the options. The most used options, appear on the top and the least used ones appear at the bottom. The furthest away from the “more options” button shouldn't be the most used ones, but quite the opposite.</p>
                <li><p><b>Hick's law</b> example: When we press the “more options” button, a lot of options appear which determines a longer period of time to make a decision. This applies both on Web and mobile. What can be adapted in this case is to group the options into main categories to decrease decision time. For example, “report a problem” and “report abuse” could be combined in a category called “ report”. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p><b>Steering's law</b> example: When we need to do anything on the app that includes menus, on Web the searching mechanism goes horizontally, while on mobile, while tapping and tapping, it goes in-depth, which of course increases the time.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>New features</b> on Google Meet</li>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A great new feature that could be added to Google Meet is <b>attendance list</b> with people and how much time they spend in the meeting. This could be very advantageous for teachers especially. This feature could just be implemented on the interface as a button that generates that list as a CSV file(or any other format)</p></li>
                <img src="meet1.png" class="image">
                <li><p>Another feature for the application that could be implemented on mobile, is a <b>shared board</b>. Right now this option isn't available, but I think it could improve the application so much. During meetings, people need to sketch their ideas and brainstorm together, so this board could be exactly the tool that they need anytime, anywhere, on their phones.
                </p></li>
                <img src="meet2.png" class="image">
                <li><p class="nopadding">Another feature, for teachers mostly, could be a tool that allows them to create <b>graded tests/graded Q&As</b> for their students. The tests should have different types, such as inbox answers, checkbox answers, or select an image as an answer. Being allowed to do that in the application could be very useful and easier for them. The results could be immediately given to the teacher as a CSV file, or in any other format. </p></li>
